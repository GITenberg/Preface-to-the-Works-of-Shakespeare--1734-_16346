<p><tt>Lewis Theobald's edition of Shakespeare (1734) is one cornerstone of
modern Shakespearian scholarship and hence of English literary scholarship in
general. It is the first edition of an English writer in which a man with a
professional breadth and concentration of reading in the writer's period tried
to bring all relevant, ascertainable fact to bear on the establishment of the
author's text and the explication of his obscurities. For Theobald was the first
editor of Shakespeare who displayed a well grounded knowledge of Shakespeare's
language and metrical practice and that of his contemporaries, the sources and
chronology of his plays, and the broad range of Elizabethan-Jacobean drama as a
means of illuminating the work of the master writer. Thus both in the edition
itself and in his Preface, which stands as the first significant statement of a
scholar's editorial duties and methods in handling an English classic, Theobald
takes his place as an important progenitor of modern English studies.</tt></p>

<p><tt>It is regrettable, though it was perhaps historically inevitable, that
this pioneer of English literary scholarship should have been tagged "piddling
Theobald" by Pope and crowned the first king of <u>The</u> <u>Dunciad</u>.
Pope's edition of Shakespeare was completed by 1725, and in the following year
Theobald made the poet his implacable enemy when he issued his <u>Shakespeare</u>
<u>Restored</u>, which demolished Pope's pretensions as an editor by offering
some two hundred corrections. But the conflict was not merely strife between two
writers: it was a clash between two kinds of criticism in which the weight of
tradition and polite taste were all on the side of Pope. What Theobald had done,
in modern terms, was to open the rift between criticism and scholarship or, in
eighteenth-century terms, to proclaim himself a "literal critic" and to insist
upon the need for "literal criticism" in the understanding and just appreciation
of an older writer. The new concept, which Theobald owed largely to Richard
Bentley as primate of the classical scholars, was of course the
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
narrower one--implicit in it was the idea of specialization--and Theobald's
opponents among the literati were quick to assail him as a mere "Word-catcher"
(cf. R.F. Jones, <u>Lewis</u> <u>Theobald</u>, 1919, p. 114).</tt></p>

<p><tt>His own edition of Shakespeare, therefore, was the work of a man and a
method on trial. At first Theobald had proposed simply to write further
commentary on Shakespeare's plays, but by 1729 he determined to issue a new
edition and in October of that year signed a contract with Tonson. From the
first Theobald found warm support for his project among booksellers, incipient
patrons, and men of learning. His work went forward steadily; subscribers,
including members of the Royal Family, were readily forthcoming; and by late
1731 Theobald felt that his labors were virtually complete. But vexing delays
occurred in the printing so that the edition, though dated 1733, did not appear
until early in 1734, New Style. When it did appear, it was plain to all that
Theobald's vindication of himself and his method was complete. Judicious critics
like the anonymous author of <u>Some</u> <u>Remarks</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Tragedy</u> <u>of</u> <u>Hamlet</u> (1736) were quick to applaud Theobald's
achievement, and even Pope himself was silenced.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Ultimately of course Theobald came under severe attack by succeeding
editors of Shakespeare, notably Warburton and Johnson, yet both men were guilty
of unwarranted abuse of their predecessor, whose edition was nine times issued
in the course of the century and was still in current use by the time of
Coleridge (cf. Wm. Jaggard, <u>Shakespeare</u> <u>Bibliography</u>, 1911, pp.
499-504). Warburton and Johnson's abuse, coupled with that of Pope, obscured
Theobald's real achievements for more than a century until J.C. Collins did much
to rehabilitate his reputation by an essay celebrating him as "The Porson of
Shakespearian Criticism" (<u>Essays</u> <u>and</u> <u>Studies</u>, 1895, pp.
263-315). Collins's emotional defense was largely substantiated by T.R.
Lounsbury's meticulous <u>The</u> <u>Text</u> <u>of</u> <u>Shakespeare</u>
(1906), R.F. Jones's <u>Lewis</u> <u>Theobald</u> (1919), which brought much new
material to light, and most recently by R.B. McKerrow's dispassionate appraisal,
"The Treatment of Shakespeare's Text by his Earlier
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
Editors, 1709-1768" (<u>Proceedings</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>British</u>
<u>Academy</u>, XIX, 1933, 23-27). As a result, so complete has been Theobald's
vindication that even in a student's handbook he is hailed as "the great pioneer
of serious Shakespeare scholarship" and as "the first giant" in the field
(<u>A</u> <u>Companion</u> <u>to</u> <u>Shakespeare</u> <u>Studies</u>, 1934,
ed. H. Granville Barker and G. B. Harrison, pp. 306-07).</tt></p>

<p><tt>Theobald's Preface occupied his attention for over a year and gave him
much trouble in the writing. Its originality was, and still is, a matter of
sharp dispute. The first we hear of it is in a letter of 12 November 1731 from
Theobald to his coadjutor Warburton, who had expressed some concern about what
Theobald planned to prefix to his edition. Theobald announced a major change in
plan when he replied that "The affair of the <u>Prolegomena</u> I have
determined to soften into a <u>Preface</u>." He then proceeded to make a strange
request:</tt></p>

<blockquote><tt>
But, dear Sir, will you, at your leisure hours, think over for me upon the
contents, topics, orders, &amp;c. of this branch of my labour? You have a
comprehensive memory, and a happiness of digesting the matter joined to it,
which my head is often too much embarrassed to perform.... But how unreasonable
is it to expect this labour, when it is the only part in which I shall not be
able to be just to my friends: for, to confess assistance in a <u>Preface</u>
will, I am afraid, make me appear too naked (John Nichols, <u>Illustrations</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Literary</u> <u>History</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Eighteenth</u> <u>Century</u>, 1817, II, 621-22).
</tt></blockquote>

<p><tt>His next letter, which contains the list of acknowledgements substantially
as printed, thanks Warburton for consenting to give the requested help,
announces that he is himself busy about "the Contents... wch. I am Endeavouring
to modell in my Head, in Order to communicate them to you, for your Directions
&amp;
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
refinement," indicates that he has "already rough-hewn the Exordium &amp;
Conclusion," and asserts that "What I shall send you from Time to Time, I look
upon only as Materials: wch I hope may grow into a fine Building, under your
judicious Management" (Jones, <u>op.</u> <u>cit.</u>, pp. 283-84).</tt></p>

<p><tt>Warburton apparently misunderstood or overlooked Theobald's remarks about
materials, for in his next letter Theobald was obliged to return, somewhat
ambiguously, to the same point:</tt></p>

<blockquote><tt>
I make no Question of my being wrong in the disjointed Parts of my Preface, but
my Intention was, (after I had given you the Conclusion, &amp; the Manner in
wch. I meant to start) to give you a List of all the other general Heads
design'd to be handled, then to transmit to you, at proper Leisure, my rough
Working off of each respective Head, that you might have the Trouble only of
refining &amp; embellishing wth: additional Inrichments: of the general
Arrangement, wch. you should think best for the whole; &amp; of making the
proper Transitions from Subject to Subject, wch. I account no inconsiderable
Beauty (<u>Ibid.</u>, pp. 289-90).
</tt></blockquote>

<p><tt>Finally on January 10, 1733, Theobald wrote Warburton: "I promise myself
now shortly to sit down upon ye fine Synopsis, wch. you so modestly call the
Skeleton of Preface" (<u>Ibid.</u>, p. 310).</tt></p>

<p><tt>It is clear from the foregoing that Theobald wrote most of the Preface
topic by topic, and probably followed the plan for the general structure as
submitted by Warburton. Yet it is equally clear that certain parts of the
Preface, such as the contrast between <u>Julius</u> <u>Caesar</u> and Addison's
<u>Cato</u>, which Warburton later claimed as his and which Theobald omitted
from his second edition, were furnished Theobald as "additional Inrichments"
(D.N. Smith, <u>Eighteenth</u> <u>Century</u> <u>Essays</u> <u>on</u> <u>Shakespeare</u>,
1903, pp. xlviii-ix). When later a break did occur between the two men,
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
neither was free from blame. Theobald had asked and got so much help with the
Preface that he should have acknowledged the debt, no matter how naked it might
have made him seem. Warburton, on the other hand, had had honest warning that
acknowledgement would not be made for this part of his help; and if his synopsis
were followed, as seems likely, his condemnation of the Preface as "Theobald's
heap of disjointed stuff" was disingenuous, to say the least. Far less
defensible was his assertion in the same letter to Thomas Birch that, apart from
the section on Greek texts, virtually the entire Preface was stitched together
from notes which he had supplied (Nichols, <u>Illustrations</u>, II, 81).</tt></p>

<p><tt>Three further points concerning the Preface demand mention. First, the
section on Shakespeare's life is often dismissed as a simple recension of Rowe's
Life (1709). Actually, however, the expansion itself is a characteristic example
of Theobald's habit of exploring original sources. To take only a single
instance, Rowe says that Shakespeare's "Family, as appears by the Register and
Publick Writings relating to that Town, were of good Figure and Fashion there,
and are mention'd as Gentlemen" (ed. S.H. Monk, Augustan Society Reprints, 1949,
p. ii). To this statement Theobald adds plentiful detail drawn from the same
Stratford records, from tombs in the Stratford Church, and from documents in the
Heralds' Office connected with the coat of arms obtained for the playwright's
father. Such typical expansions were the result of conscientious research.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Second, all critics have agreed to condemn the digression in which
Theobald advertised his ability to emend Greek texts. Theobald himself was
hesitant about including it lest he be indicted for pedantry, but was encouraged
to do so by Warburton, who later scoffed at what he had originally admired. This
much may be said in Theobald's behalf. Such a digression would not have seemed
irrelevant in an age which took its classical scholarship seriously; and such
digressions, arising naturally out of context and strategically placed before
the conclusion, were not
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
only allowed but actually encouraged by classical rhetoricians like Cicero and
Quintilian, whose teachings were still standard in the English schools.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Finally, the Preface exists in two forms. The later and shorter form was
that designed for Theobald's second edition (1740), which omits all passages
presumably contributed by Warburton and more besides, the section on Greek
texts, and the list of acknowledgements to contemporary Shakespearian enthusiasts.
This abridged form has been frequently reprinted. From a copy in the University
of Michigan Library the original Preface is here reproduced for the first
time.</tt></p>

<span class = "firstletter">T</span>HE Attempt to write upon <span class =

splendid Dome thro’ the Conveyance of a narrow and obscure Entry. A Glare of
Light suddenly breaks upon you, beyond what the Avenue at first promis’d: and a
thousand Beauties of Genius and Character, like so many gaudy Apartments pouring
at once upon the Eye, diffuse and throw themselves out to the Mind. The Prospect
is too wide to come within the Compass of a single View: ’tis a gay Confusion of
pleasing Objects, too various to be enjoyed but in a general Admiration; and
they must be separated, and ey’d distinctly, in order to give the proper
Entertainment.</p>

<p class = "preface">
And as in great Piles of Building, some Parts are often finish’d up to hit the
Taste of the <i>Connoisseur</i>; others more negligently put together, to strike
the Fancy of a common
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
and unlearned Beholder: Some Parts are made stupendiously magnificent and grand,
to surprize with the vast Design and Execution of the Architect; others are
contracted, to amuse you with his Neatness and Elegance in little.
<span class = "footnote"><i>A sketch of </i>Shakespeare’s<i> general Character.</i></span>
So, in <i>Shakespeare</i>, we may find <i>Traíts</i> that will stand the Test of
the severest Judgment; and Strokes as carelessly hit off, to the Level of the
more ordinary Capacities: Some Descriptions rais’d to that Pitch of Grandeur, as
to astonish you with the Compass and Elevation of his Thought: and others
copying Nature within so narrow, so confined a Circle, as if the Author’s Talent
lay only at drawing in Miniature.</p>

<p class = "preface">
In how many Points of Light must we be oblig’d to gaze at this great Poet! In
how many Branches of Excellence to consider, and admire him! Whether we view him
on the Side of Art or Nature, he ought equally to engage our Attention: Whether
we respect the Force and Greatness of his Genius, the Extent of his Knowledge
and Reading, the Power and Address with which he throws out and applies either
Nature, or Learning, there is ample Scope both for our Wonder and Pleasure. If
his Diction, and the cloathing of his Thoughts attract us, how much more must we
be charm’d with the Richness, and Variety, of his Images and Ideas! If his
Images and Ideas steal into our Souls, and strike upon our Fancy, how much are
they improv’d
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
in Price, when we come to reflect with what Propriety and Justness they are
apply’d to Character! If we look into his Characters, and how they are furnish’d
and proportion’d to the Employment he cuts out for them, how are we taken up
with the Mastery of his Portraits! What Draughts of Nature! What Variety of
Originals, and how differing each from the other! How are they dress’d from the
Stores of his own luxurious Imagination; without being the Apes of Mode, or
borrowing from any foreign Wardrobe! Each of Them are the Standards of Fashion
for themselves: like Gentlemen that are above the Direction of their Tailors,
and can adorn themselves without the Aid of Imitation. If other Poets draw more
than one Fool or Coxcomb, there is the same Resemblance in them, as in that
Painter’s Draughts, who was happy only at forming a Rose: you find them all
younger Brothers of the same Family, and all of them have a Pretence to give the
same Crest: But <i>Shakespeare</i>’s Clowns and Fops come all of a different
House: they are no farther allied to one another than as Man to Man, Members of
the same Species: but as different in Features and Lineaments of Character, as
we are from one another in Face, or Complexion. But I am unawares launching into
his Character as a Writer, before I have said what I intended of him as a
private Member of the Republick.</p>
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "sidenote"><i>Some Particulars of his private Life.</i></span>
Mr. <i>Rowe</i> has very justly observ’d, that People are fond of discovering
any little personal Story of the Great Men of Antiquity: and that the common
Accidents of their Lives naturally become the Subject of our critical Enquiries:
That however trifling such a Curiosity at the first View may appear, yet, as for
what relates to Men of Letters, the Knowledge of an Author may, perhaps,
sometimes conduce to the better understanding his Works: And, indeed, this
Author’s Works, from the bad Treatment he has met with from his Editors, have so
long wanted a Comment, that one would zealously embrace every Method of
Information, that could contribute to recover them from the Injuries with which
they have so long lain o’erwhelm’d.</p>

<p class = "preface">
’Tis certain, that if we have first admir’d the Man in his Writings, his Case is
so circumstanc’d, that we must naturally admire the Writings in the Man: That if
we go back to take a View of his Education, and the Employment in Life which
Fortune had cut out for him, we shall retain the stronger Ideas of his extensive
Genius.</p>

<p class = "preface">
His Father, we are told, was a considerable Dealer in Wool; but having no fewer
than ten Children, of whom our <i>Shakespeare</i> was the eldest, the best
Education he could afford him was no better than to qualify him for his own
Business and Employment. I cannot affirm with any Certainty how long his
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
Father liv’d; but I take him to be the same Mr. <i>John Shakespeare</i> who was
living in the Year 1599, and who then, in Honour of his Son, took out an Extract
of his Family-Arms from the Herald’s Office; by which it appears, that he had
been Officer and Bailiff of <i>Stratford</i>, and that he enjoy’d some
hereditary Lands and Tenements, the Reward of his Great Grandfather’s faithful
and approved Service to King <i>Henry</i> VII.</p>

<p class = "preface">
Be this as it will, our <i>Shakespeare</i>, it seems, was bred for some Time at
a Free-School; the very Free-School, I presume, founded at <i>Stratford</i>:
where, we are told, he acquired what <i>Latin</i> he was Master of: but, that
his Father being oblig’d, thro’ Narrowness of Circumstance, to withdraw him too
soon from thence, he was so unhappily prevented from making any Proficiency in
the Dead Languages: A Point, that will deserve some little Discussion in the
Sequel of this Dissertation.</p>

<p class = "preface">
How long he continued in his Father’s Way of Business, either as an Assistant to
him, or on his own proper Account, no Notices are left to inform us: nor have I
been able to learn precisely at what Period of Life he quitted his native
<i>Stratford</i>, and began his Acquaintance with <i>London</i>, and the
<i>Stage</i>.</p>

<p class = "preface">
In order to settle in the World after a Family-manner, he thought fit, Mr.
<i>Rowe</i> acquaints us, to marry while he was yet very young. It is certain,
he did so: for by the
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
Monument, in <i>Stratford</i> Church, erected to the Memory of his Daughter
<i>Susanna</i>, the Wife of <i>John Hall</i>, Gentleman, it appears, that she
died on the 2d Day of <i>July</i> in the Year 1649, aged 66. So that She was
born in 1583, when her Father could not be full 19 Years old; who was himself
born in the Year 1564. Nor was She his eldest Child, for he had another
Daughter, <i>Judith</i>, who was born before her, and who was married to one Mr.
<i>Thomas Quiney</i>. So that <i>Shakespeare</i> must have entred into Wedlock,
by that Time he was turn’d of seventeen Years.</p>

<p class = "preface">
Whether the Force of Inclination merely, or some concurring Circumstances of
Convenience in the Match, prompted him to marry so early, is not easy to be
determin’d at this Distance: but ’tis probable, a View of Interest might partly
sway his Conduct in this Point: for he married the Daughter of one <i>Hathaway</i>,
a substantial Yeoman in his Neighbourhood, and She had the Start of him in Age
no less than 8 Years. She surviv’d him, notwithstanding, seven Seasons, and dy’d
that very Year in which the <i>Players</i> publish’d the first Edition of his
Works in <i>Folio</i>, Anno Dom. 1623, at the Age of 67 Years, as we likewise

Tradition be true, of that Extravagance which forc’d him both to quit his
Country and way of Living; to wit, his being engag’d, with a Knot of young
Deer-stealers, to rob the Park of Sir <i>Thomas Lucy</i> of <i>Cherlecot</i>
near <i>Stratford</i>: the Enterprize favours so much of Youth and Levity, we
may reasonably suppose it was before he could write full <ins class =

considering too, that he had retir’d from the Stage, to spend the latter Part of
his Days at his own Native <i>Stratford</i>; the Interval of Time, necessarily
required for the finishing so many Dramatic Pieces, obliges us to suppose he
threw himself very early upon the Play-house. And as he could, probably,
contract no Acquaintance with the Drama, while he was driving on the Affair of
Wool at home; some Time must be lost, even after he had commenc’d Player, before
he could attain Knowledge enough in the Science to qualify himself for turning

It has been observ’d by Mr. <i>Rowe</i>, that, amongst other Extravagancies
which our Author has given to his Sir <i>John Falstaffe</i>, in the <i>Merry
Wives</i> of <i>Windsor</i>, he has made him a Deer-stealer; and that he might
at the same
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
time remember his <i>Warwickshire</i> Prosecutor, under the Name of Justice
<i>Shallow</i>, he has given him very near the same Coat of Arms, which
<i>Dugdale</i>, in his Antiquities of that County, describes for a Family there.
There are two Coats, I observe, in <i>Dugdale</i>, where three Silver Fishes are
borne in the Name of <i>Lucy</i>; and another Coat, to the Monument of <i>Thomas
Lucy</i>, Son of Sir <i>William Lucy</i>, in which are quarter’d in four several
Divisions, twelve little Fishes, three in each Division, probably <i>Luces</i>.
This very Coat, indeed, seems alluded to in <i>Shallow</i>’s giving the
<i>dozen</i> White <i>Luces</i>, and in <i>Slender</i> saying, <i>he may
quarter</i>. When I consider the exceeding Candour and Good-nature of our
Author, (which inclin’d all the gentler Part of the World to love him; as the
Power of his Wit obliged the Men of the most delicate Knowledge and polite
Learning to admire him;) and that he should throw this humorous Piece of Satire
at his Prosecutor, at least twenty Years after the Provocation given; I am
confidently persuaded it must be owing to an unforgiving Rancour on the
Prosecutor’s Side: and if This was the Case, it were Pity but the Disgrace of
such an Inveteracy should remain as a lasting Reproach, and <i>Shallow</i> stand
as a Mark of Ridicule to stigmatize his Malice.</p>

It is said, our Author spent some Years before his Death, in Ease, Retirement,
and the Conversation of his Friends, at his Native
<span class = "pagenum">ix<br>a2</span>
<i>Stratford</i>. I could never pick up any certain Intelligence, when He
relinquish’d the Stage. I know, it has been mistakenly thought by some, that
<i>Spenser</i>’s <i>Thalia</i>, in his <i>Tears of his Muses</i>, where she
laments the Loss of her <i>Willy</i> in the Comic Scene, has been apply’d to our
Author’s quitting the Stage. But <i>Spenser</i> himself, ’tis well known,
quitted the Stage of Life in the Year 1598; and, five Years after this, we find
<i>Shakespeare</i>’s Name among the Actors in <i>Ben Jonson</i>’s <i>Sejanus</i>,
which first made its Appearance in the Year 1603. Nor, surely, could he then
have any Thoughts of retiring, since, that very Year, a Licence under the
Privy-Seal was granted by K.&nbsp;<i>James</i>&nbsp;I. to him and <i>Fletcher</i>,
<i>Burbage</i>, <i>Phillippes</i>, <i>Hemmings</i>, <i>Condel</i>, &amp;c.
authorizing them to exercise the Art of playing Comedies, Tragedies, &amp;c. as
well at their usual House call’d the <i>Globe</i> on the other Side of the
Water, as in any other Parts of the Kingdom, during his Majesty’s Pleasure: (A
Copy of which Licence is preserv’d in <i>Rymer</i>’s <i>Foedera</i>.) Again,
’tis certain, that <i>Shakespeare</i> did not exhibit his <i>Macbeth</i>, till
after the <i>Union</i> was brought about, and till after K.&nbsp;<i>James</i>&nbsp;I.
had begun to touch for the <i>Evil</i>: for ’tis plain, he has inserted
Compliments, on both those Accounts, upon his Royal Master in that Tragedy.</p>

<p class = "preface">
Nor, indeed, could the Number of the Dramatic Pieces, he produced, admit of his
retiring near so early as that Period. So
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
that what <i>Spenser</i> there says, if it relate at all to <i>Shakespeare</i>,
must hint at some occasional Recess he made for a time upon a Disgust taken: or
the <i>Willy</i>, there mention’d, must relate to some other favourite Poet. I
believe, we may safely determine that he had not quitted in the Year 1610. For
in his <i>Tempest</i>, our Author makes mention of the <i>Bermuda</i> Islands,
which were unknown to the <i>English</i>, till, in 1609, Sir <i>John Summers</i>
made a Voyage to <i>North-America</i>, and discover’d them: and afterwards
invited some of his Countrymen to settle a Plantation there. That he became the
private Gentleman at least three Years before his Decease, is pretty obvious
from another Circumstance: I mean, from that remarkable and well-known Story,
which Mr. <i>Rowe</i> has given us of our Author’s Intimacy with Mr. <i>John
Combe</i>, an old Gentleman noted thereabouts for his Wealth and Usury: and upon
whom <i>Shakespeare</i> made the following facetious Epitaph.</p>

<div class = "verse">

</div>

<p class = "preface">
This sarcastical Piece of Wit was, at the Gentleman’s own Request, thrown out
extemporally in his Company. And this Mr. <i>John Combe</i> I take to be the
same, who, by
<span class = "pagenum">xi<br>a3</span>
<i>Dugdale</i> in his Antiquities of <i>Warwickshire</i>, is said to have dy’d
in the Year 1614, and for whom at the upper End of the Quire, of the Guild of
the Holy Cross at <i>Stratford</i>, a fair Monument is erected, having a Statue
thereon cut in Alabaster, and in a Gown with this Epitaph. “Here lyeth
enterr’d the Body of <i>John Combe</i> Esq; who dy’d the 10th of <i>July</i>,
1614, who bequeathed several Annual Charities to the Parish of <i>Stratford</i>,
and 100<i>l.</i> to be lent to fifteen poor Tradesmen from three years to three
years, changing the Parties every third Year, at the Rate of fifty Shillings
<i>per Annum</i>, the Increase to be distributed to the Almes-poor there.”&mdash;The
Donation has all the Air of a rich and sagacious Usurer.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<i>Shakespeare</i> himself did not survive Mr. <i>Combe</i> long, for he dy’d in
the Year 1616, the 53d of his Age. He lies buried on the North Side of the
Chancel in the great Church at <i>Stratford</i>; where a Monument, decent enough
for the Time, is erected to him, and plac’d against the Wall. He is represented
under an Arch in a sitting Posture, a Cushion spread before him, with a Pen in
his Right Hand, and his Left rested on a Scrowl of Paper. The <i>Latin</i>
Distich, which is placed under the Cushion, has been given us by Mr. <i>Pope</i>,
or his Graver, in this Manner.</p>

In 1614, the greater part of the Town of <i>Stratford</i> was consumed by Fire;
but our <i>Shakespeare</i>’s House, among some others, escap’d the Flames. This
House was first built by Sir <i>Hugh Clopton</i>, a younger Brother of an
ancient Family in that Neighbourhood, who took their Name from the Manor of
<i>Clopton</i>. Sir <i>Hugh</i> was Sheriff of <i>London</i> in the Reign of
<i>Richard</i> III, and Lord Mayor in the Reign of King <i>Henry</i> VII. To
this Gentleman the Town of <i>Stratford</i> is indebted for the fine Stone-bridge,
consisting of fourteen Arches, which at an extraordinary Expence he built over
the <i>Avon</i>, together with a Cause-way running at the West-end thereof;
<span class = "pagenum">xiii<br>a4</span>
as also for rebuilding the Chapel adjoining to his House, and the Cross-Isle in
the Church there. It is remarkable of him, that, tho’ he liv’d and dy’d a
Batchelor, among the other extensive Charities which he left both to the City of
<i>London</i> and Town of <i>Stratford</i>, he bequeath’d considerable Legacies
for the Marriage of poor Maidens of good Name and Fame both in <i>London</i> and
at <i>Stratford</i>. Notwithstanding which large Donations in his Life, and
Bequests at his Death, as he had purchased the Manor of <i>Clopton</i>, and all
the Estate of the Family, so he left the same again to his Elder Brother’s Son
with a very great Addition: (a Proof, how well Beneficence and Oeconomy may walk
hand in hand in wise Families:) Good part of which Estate is yet in the
Possession of <i>Edward Clopton</i>, Esq; and Sir <i>Hugh Clopton</i>, Knt.
lineally descended from the Elder Brother of the first Sir <i>Hugh</i>: Who
particularly bequeathed to his Nephew, by his Will, his House, by the Name of
his <i>Great-house</i> in <i>Stratford</i>.</p>

<p class = "preface">
The Estate had now been sold out of the <i>Clopton</i> Family for above a
Century, at the Time when <i>Shakespeare</i> became the Purchaser: who, having
repair’d and modell’d it to his own Mind, chang’d the Name to <i>New-place</i>;
which the Mansion-house, since erected upon the same Spot, at this day retains.
The House and Lands, which attended it, continued in <i>Shakespeare</i>’s
Descendants to the
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
Time of the <i>Restoration</i>: when they were repurchased by the <i>Clopton</i>
Family, and the Mansion now belongs to Sir <i>Hugh Clopton</i>, Knt. To the
Favour of this worthy Gentleman I owe the Knowledge of one Particular, in Honour
of our Poet’s once Dwelling-house, of which, I presume, Mr. <span class =
"extended">Rowe</span> never was appriz’d. When the Civil War raged in
<i>England</i>, and K. <i>Charles</i> the <i>First’s</i> Queen was driven by the
Necessity of Affairs to make a Recess in <i>Warwickshire</i>, She kept her Court
for three Weeks in <i>New-place</i>. We may reasonably suppose it then the best
private House in the Town; and her Majesty preferr’d it to the <i>College</i>,
which was in the Possession of the <i>Combe</i>-Family, who did not so strongly
favour the King’s Party.</p>

<p class = "preface">
How much our Author employ’d himself in Poetry, after his Retirement from the
Stage, does not so evidently appear: Very few posthumous Sketches of his Pen
have been recover’d to ascertain that Point. We have been told, indeed, in
Print, but not till very lately, That two large Chests full of this Great Man’s
loose Papers and Manuscripts, in the Hands of an ignorant Baker of <i>Warwick</i>,
(who married one of the Descendants from our <i>Shakespeare</i>) were carelesly
scatter’d and thrown about, as Garret-Lumber, and Litter, to the particular
Knowledge of the late Sir <i>William Bishop</i>, till they were all consumed in
the general Fire and Destruction, of that
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
Town. I cannot help being a little apt to distrust the Authority of this
Tradition; because as his Wife surviv’d him seven Years, and as his Favourite
Daughter <i>Susanna</i> surviv’d her twenty six Years, ’tis very improbable,
they should suffer such a Treasure to be remov’d, and translated into a remoter
Branch of the Family, without a Scrutiny first made into the Value of it. This,
I say, inclines me to distrust the Authority of the Relation: but, notwithstanding
such an apparent Improbability, if we really lost such a Treasure, by whatever
Fatality or Caprice of Fortune they came into such ignorant and neglectful
Hands, I agree with the <i>Relater</i>, the Misfortune is wholly irreparable.</p>

<p class = "preface">
To these Particulars, which regard his Person and private Life, some few more
are to be glean’d from Mr. <span class = "extended">Rowe</span>’s Account of his
<i>Life</i> and <i>Writings</i>:
<span class = "sidenote"><i>His Character as a </i>Writer<i>.</i></span>
Let us now take a short View of him in his publick Capacity, as&nbsp;a
<i>Writer</i>: and, from thence, the Transition will be easy to the <i>State</i>
in which his <i>Writings</i> have been handed down to us.</p>

<p class = "preface">
No Age, perhaps, can produce an Author more various from himself, than
<i>Shakespeare</i> has been universally acknowledg’d to be. The Diversity in
Stile, and other Parts of Composition, so obvious in him, is as variously to be
accounted for. His Education, we find, was at best but begun: and he started
early into a Science from the Force of Genius,
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
unequally assisted by acquir’d Improvements. His Fire, Spirit, and Exuberance of
Imagination gave an Impetuosity to his Pen: His Ideas flow’d from him in a
Stream rapid, but not turbulent; copious, but not ever overbearing its Shores.
The Ease and Sweetness of his Temper might not a little contribute to his
Facility in Writing; as his Employment, as a <i>Player</i>, gave him an
Advantage and Habit of fancying himself the very Character he meant to
delineate. He used the Helps of his Function in forming himself to create and
express that <i>Sublime</i>, which other Actors can only copy, and throw out, in
Action and graceful Attitude. But <i>Nullum fine Veniâ placuit Ingenium</i>,
says <i>Seneca</i>. The Genius, that gives us the greatest Pleasure, sometimes
stands in Need of our Indulgence. Whenever this happens with regard to
<i>Shakespeare</i>, I would willingly impute it to a Vice of <i>his Times</i>.
We see Complaisance enough, in our own Days, paid to a <i>bad Taste</i>. His
<i>Clinches</i>, <i>false Wit</i>, and descending beneath himself, seem to be a
Deference paid to <i>reigning Barbarism</i>. He was a <i>Sampson</i> in
Strength, but he suffer’d some such <i>Dalilah</i> to give him up to the
<i>Philistines</i>.</p>

<p class = "preface">
As I have mention’d the Sweetness of his Disposition, I am tempted to make a
Reflexion or two on a Sentiment of his, which, I am persuaded, came from the
Heart.</p>
<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
<div class = "verse">
<i>The Man, that hath no Musick in himself,<br>
Nor is not mov’d with Concord of sweet Sounds,<br>

</div>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "sidenote"><i>A Lover of </i>Musick<i>.</i></span>
<i>Shakespeare</i> was all Openness, Candour, and Complacence; and had such a
Share of Harmony in his Frame and Temperature, that we have no Reason to doubt,
from a Number of fine Passages, Allusions, Similies, &amp;<i>c.</i> fetch’d from
<i>Musick</i>, but that He was a passionate Lover of it. And to this, perhaps,
we may owe that great Number of <i>Sonnets</i>, which are sprinkled thro’ his
<i>Plays</i>. I have found, that the <ins class = "correction" title =
"apostrophe in original">Stanza’s</ins> sung by the Gravedigger in <i>Hamlet</i>,
are not of <i>Shakespeare</i>’s own Composition, but owe their Original to the
old Earl of <i>Surrey</i>’s Poems. Many other of his Occasional little Songs, I
doubt not, but he purposely copied from his Contemporary Writers; sometimes, out
of Banter; sometimes, to do them Honour. The Manner of their Introduction, and
the Uses to which he has assigned them, will easily determine for which of the
Reasons they are respectively employ’d. In <i>As you like it</i>, there are
several little Copies of Verses on <i>Rosalind</i>, which are said to be the
right <i>Butter-woman’s Rank to Market</i>, and the very <i>false Gallop of
Verses</i>. Dr. <i>Thomas
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
Lodge</i>, a Physician who flourish’d early in Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign,
and was a great Writer of the Pastoral Songs and Madrigals, which were so much
the Strain of those Times, composed a whole Volume of Poems in Praise of his
Mistress, whom he calls <i>Rosalinde</i>. I never yet could meet with this
Collection; but whenever I do, I am persuaded, I shall find many of our Author’s
Canzonets on this Subject to be Scraps of the Doctor’s amorous Muse: as,
perhaps, those by <i>Biron</i> too, and the other Lovers in <i>Love’s Labour’s
lost</i>, may prove to be.</p>

<p class = "preface">
It has been remark’d in the Course of my Notes, that Musick in our Author’s time
had a very different Use from what it has now. At this Time, it is only employ’d
to raise and inflame the Passions; it, then, was apply’d to calm and allay all
kinds of Perturbations. And, agreeable to this Observation, throughout all
<i>Shakespeare</i>’s Plays, where Musick is either actually used, or its Powers
describ’d, it is chiefly said to be for these Ends. His <i>Twelfth-Night</i>,
particularly, begins with a fine Reflexion that admirably marks its soothing
Properties.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<i>That Strain again;&mdash;It had a dying Fall.<br>
Oh, it came o’er my Ear like the sweet South,<br>
That breathes upon a Bank of Violets,<br>

</div>

<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
<p class = "preface">
This <i>Similitude</i> is remarkable not only for the Beauty of the Image that
it presents, but likewise for the Exactness to the Thing compared. This is a way
of Teaching peculiar to the Poets; that, when they would describe the Nature of
any thing, they do it not by a direct Enumeration of its Attributes or
Qualities, but by bringing something into Comparison, and describing those
Qualities of it that are of the Kind with those in the Thing compared. So, here
for instance, the Poet willing to instruct in the Properties of Musick, in which
the same Strains have a Power to excite Pleasure, or Pain, according to that
State of Mind the Hearer is then in, does it by presenting the Image of a sweet
South Wind blowing o’er a Violet-bank; which wafts away the Odour of the
Violets, and at the same time communicates to it its own Sweetness: by This
insinuating, that affecting Musick, tho’ it takes away the natural sweet
Tranquillity of the Mind, yet, at the same time, communicates a Pleasure the
Mind felt not before. This Knowledge, of the same Objects being capable of
raising two contrary Affections, is a Proof of no ordinary Progress in the Study
of human Nature.
<span class = "sidenote">Milton<i> an Imitator of him.</i></span>
The general
Beauties of those two Poems of <span class = "extended">Milton</span>, intitled,
<i>L’Allegro</i> and <i>Il Pensoroso</i>, are obvious to all Readers, because
the Descriptions are the most poetical in the World; yet there is a peculiar
Beauty in those two excellent
<span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
Pieces, that will much enhance the Value of them to the more capable Readers;
which has never, I think, been observ’d. The Images, in each Poem, which he
raises to excite Mirth and Melancholy, are exactly the same, only shewn in
different Attitudes. Had a Writer, less acquainted with Nature, given us two
Poems on these Subjects, he would have been sure to have sought out the most
contrary Images to raise these contrary Passions. And, particularly, as
<i>Shakespeare</i>, in the Passage I am now commenting, speaks of these
different Effects in Musick; so <i>Milton</i> has brought it into each Poem as
the Exciter of each Affection: and lest we should mistake him, as meaning that
different Airs had this different Power, (which every Fidler is proud to have
you understand,) He gives the Image of those self-same Strains that <i>Orpheus</i>
used to regain <i>Eurydice</i>, as proper both to excite Mirth and Melancholy.
But <i>Milton</i> most industriously copied the Conduct of our <i>Shakespeare</i>,
in Passages that shew’d an intimate Acquaintance with Nature and Science.</p>

<span class = "sidenote">Shakespeare’s <i>Knowledge of Nature.</i></span>
I have not thought it out of my Province, whenever Occasion offer’d, to take
notice of some of our Poet’s grand Touches of Nature: Some, that do not appear
superficially such; but in which he seems the most deeply instructed; and to
which, no doubt, he has so much ow’d that happy Preservation of his
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
<i>Characters</i>, for which he is justly celebrated. If he was not acquainted
with the Rule as deliver’d by <i>Horace</i>, his own admirable Genius pierc’d
into the Necessity of such a Rule.</p>

For what can be more ridiculous, than, in our modern Writers, to make a
debauch’d young Man, immers’d in all the Vices of his Age and Time, in a few
hours take up, confine himself in the way of Honour to one Woman, and moralize
in good earnest on the Follies of his past Behaviour? Nor can, that great
Examplar of <i>Comic</i> Writing, <i>Terence</i> be altogether excused in this
Regard; who, in his <i>Adelphi</i>, has left <i>Demea</i> in the last Scenes so
unlike himself: whom, as <i>Shakespeare</i> expresses it, <i>he has turn’d with
the seamy Side of his Wit outward</i>. This Conduct, as Errors are more readily
imitated than Perfections, <i>Beaumont</i> and <i>Fletcher</i> seem to have
follow’d in a Character in their <i>Scornful Lady</i>. It may be objected,
perhaps, by some who do not go to the Bottom of our Poet’s Conduct, that he has
likewise transgress’d against the Rule himself, by making Prince <i>Harry</i> at
once, upon coming to the Crown, throw off his former Dissoluteness, and take up
the Practice of a sober Morality and all the kingly Virtues. But this would be a
mistaken Objection. The Prince’s Reformation is not
<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
so sudden, as not to be prepar’d and expected by the Audience. He gives, indeed,
a Loose to Vanity, and a light unweigh’d Behaviour, when he is trifling among
his dissolute Companions; but the Sparks of innate Honour and true Nobleness
break from him upon every proper Occasion, where we would hope to see him awake
to Sentiments suiting his Birth and Dignity. And our Poet has so well, and
artfully, guarded his Character from the Suspicions of habitual and unreformable
Profligateness; that even from the first shewing him upon the Stage, in the
first Part of <i>Henry</i> IV, when he made him consent to join with <i>Falstaffe</i>
in a Robbery on the Highway, he has taken care not to carry him off the Scene,
without an Intimation that he knows them all, and their unyok’d Humour; and
that, like the Sun, he will permit them only for a while to obscure and cloud
his Brightness; then break thro’ the Mist, when he pleases to be himself again;
that his Lustre, when wanted, may be the more wonder’d at.</p>

<p class = "preface">
Another of <i>Shakespeare</i>’s grand Touches of Nature, and which lies still
deeper from the Ken of common Observation, has been taken notice of in a Note
upon <i>The Tempest</i>; where <i>Prospero</i> at once interrupts the Masque of
<i>Spirits</i>, and starts into a sudden Passion and Disorder of Mind. As the
latent Cause of his Emotion is there fully inquir’d into, I shall no farther
dwell upon it here.</p>
<span class = "pagenum">xxiii<br>b</span>

<p class = "preface">
Such a Conduct in a Poet (as <i>Shakespeare</i> has manifested on many like
Occasions;) where the Turn of <i>Action</i> arises from Reflexions of his
<i>Characters</i>, where the Reason of it is not express’d in Words, but drawn
from the inmost Resources of Nature, shews him truly capable of that Art, which
is more in Rule than Practice: <i>Ars est celare Artem</i>. ’Tis the Foible of
your worser Poets to make a Parade and Ostentation of that little Science they
have; and to throw it out in the most ambitious Colours. And whenever a Writer
of this Class shall attempt to copy these artful Concealments of our Author, and
shall either think them easy, or practised by a Writer for his Ease, he will
soon be convinced of his Mistake by the Difficulty of reaching the Imitation of
them.</p>

</div>

<p class = "preface">
Another grand Touch of Nature in our Author, (not less difficult to imitate,
tho’ more obvious to the Remark of a common Reader) is, when he brings down at
once any <i>Character</i> from the Ferment and Height of Passion, makes him
correct himself for the unruly Disposition, and fall into Reflexions of a sober
and moral Tenour. An exquisite fine Instance of this Kind occurs in <i>Lear</i>,
where that old King, hasty and intemperate in his Passions, coming to his Son
and Daughter
<span class = "pagenum">xxiv</span>
<i>Cornwall</i>, is told by the Earl of <i>Gloucester</i> that they are not to
be spoken with: and thereupon throws himself into a Rage, supposing the Excuse
of Sickness and Weariness in them to be a purpos’d Contempt: <i>Gloucester</i>
begs him to think of the fiery and unremoveable Quality of the Duke: and This,
which was design’d to qualify his Passion, serves to exaggerate the Transports
of it.</p>

<p class = "preface">
As the Conduct of Prince <i>Henry</i> in the first Instance, the secret and
mental Reflexions in the Case of <i>Prospero</i>, and the instant Detour of
<i>Lear</i> from the Violence of Rage to a Temper of Reasoning, do so much
Honour to that <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'surpizing'">surprizing</ins>
Knowledge of human Nature, which is certainly our Author’s Masterpiece, I
thought, they could not be set in too good a Light. Indeed, to point out, and
exclaim upon, all the Beauties of <i>Shakespeare</i>, as they come singly in
Review, would be as insipid, as endless; as tedious, as unnecessary: But the
Explanation of those Beauties, that are less obvious to common Readers, and
whose Illustration depends on the Rules of just Criticism, and an exact
Knowledge of human Life, should deservedly have a Share in a general Critic upon
the Author.</p>

<p class = "preface">
I shall dismiss the Examination into these his latent Beauties, when I have made
a short Comment upon a remarkable Passage from <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, which is

That nice Critick <i>Dionysius</i> of <i>Halicarnassus</i> confesses, that he
could not find those great Strokes, which he calls the <i>terrible Graces</i>,
in any of the Historians, which he frequently met with in <i>Homer</i>. I
believe, the Success would be the same likewise, if we sought for them in any
other of <i>our</i> Authors besides our <i>British</i>
<span class = "extended">Homer</span>,
<i>Shakespeare</i>. This Description of the Condition of Conspirators has a Pomp
and Terror in it, that perfectly astonishes. Our excellent Mr. <i>Addison</i>,
whose Modesty made him sometimes diffident in his own Genius, but whose
exquisite Judgment always led him to the safest Guides, as we may see by those
many fine Strokes in his <i>Cato</i> borrow’d from the <i>Philippics</i> of
<i>Cicero</i>, has paraphrased this fine Description; but we are no longer to
expect those <i>terrible Graces</i>, which he could not hinder from evaporating
in the Transfusion.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxvi</span>
<div class = "verse">
<i>O think, what anxious Moments pass between<br>

</div>

<p class = "preface">
I shall observe two Things on this fine Imitation: first, that the Subjects of
these two Conspiracies being so very different, (the Fortunes of <i>Cæsar</i>
and the <i>Roman</i> Empire being concern’d in the First; and That of only a few
Auxiliary Troops, in the other;) Mr. <i>Addison</i> could not with Propriety
bring in that magnificent Circumstance, which gives the terrible Grace to
<i>Shakespeare</i>’s Description.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<i>The Genius and the mortal Instruments<br>
Are then in Council.</i>&mdash;&mdash;
</div>

<p class = "preface">
For Kingdoms, in the poetical Theology, besides their good, have their evil
<i>Genius</i>’s likewise: represented here with the most daring Stretch of
Fancy, as fitting in Council with the Conspirators, whom he calls the <i>mortal
Instruments</i>. But this Would have been too great an Apparatus to the Rape,
and Desertion, of <i>Syphax</i>, and <i>Sempronius</i>. Secondly, The other
Thing very observable is, that Mr. <i>Addison</i> was so warm’d and affected
with the Fire of <i>Shakespeare</i>’s Description; that, instead of copying his
Author’s Sentiments, he has, before he was aware, given us only the Image of his
own Impressions on the reading his great Original. For,</p>
<span class = "pagenum">xxvii<br>b3</span>
<div class = "verse">
<i>Oh, ’tis a dreadful Interval of Time,<br>
Fill’d up with Horror all, and big with Death;</i>
</div>
<p class = "preface">
are but the Affections raised by such forcible Images as these;</p>
<div class = "verse">
&mdash;&mdash;<i>All the </i>Int’rim<i> is<br>

&mdash;&mdash;<i>the State of Man,<br>

</div>
<p class = "preface">
Comparing the Mind of a Conspirator to an Anarchy, is just and beautiful; but
the <i>Interim</i> to a <i>hideous Dream</i> has something in it so wonderfully
natural, and lays the human Soul so open, that one cannot but be surpriz’d, that
any Poet, who had not himself been, some time or other, engaged in a Conspiracy,
could ever have given such Force of Colouring to Truth and Nature.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "sidenote"><i>The Question on </i>Shakespeare<i>’s Learning
handled.</i></span>
It has been allow’d on all hands, far our Author was indebted to <i>Nature</i>;
it is not so well agreed, how much he ow’d to <i>Languages</i> and acquir’d
<i>Learning</i>. The Decisions on this Subject were certainly set on Foot by the
Hint from <i>Ben Jonson</i>, that he had small <i>Latin</i> and less <i>Greek</i>:
And from this Tradition, as it were, Mr. <i>Rowe</i> has thought fit peremptorily
to declare, that, “It is without Controversy, he had no Knowledge of the
Writings of the ancient Poets, for that in his Works we find no Traces
of
<span class = "pagenum">xxviii</span>
any thing which looks like an Imitation of the Ancients. For the Delicacy of his
Taste (<i>continues He</i>,) and the natural Bent of his own great Genius
(equal, if not superior, to some of the Best of theirs;) would certainly have
led him to read and study them with so much Pleasure, that some of their fine
Images would naturally have insinuated themselves into, and been mix’d with, his
own Writings: so that his not copying, at least, something from them, may be an
Argument of his never having read them.” I shall leave it to the Determination
of my Learned Readers, from the numerous Passages, which I have occasionally
quoted in my Notes, in which our Poet seems closely to have imitated the
Classics, whether Mr. <i>Rowe</i>’s Assertion be so absolutely to be depended
on. The Result of the Controversy must certainly, either way, terminate to our
Author’s Honour: how happily he could imitate them, if that Point be allow’d; or
how gloriously he could think like them, without owing any thing to Imitation.</p>

<p class = "preface">
Tho’ I should be very unwilling to allow <i>Shakespeare</i> so poor a Scholar,
as Many have labour’d to represent him, yet I shall be very cautious of
declaring too positively on the other side of the Question: that is, with regard
to my Opinion of his Knowledge in the dead Languages. And therefore the
Passages, that
<span class = "pagenum">xxix<br>b4</span> I occasionally quote from the
<i>Classics</i>, shall not be urged as Proofs that he knowingly imitated those
Originals; but brought to shew how happily he has express’d himself upon the
same Topicks. A very learned Critick of our own Nation has declar’d, that a
Sameness of Thought and Sameness of Expression too, in Two Writers of a
different Age, can hardly happen, without a violent Suspicion of the Latter
copying from his Predecessor. I shall not therefore run any great Risque of a
Censure, tho’ I should venture to hint, that the Resemblance, in Thought and
Expression, of our Author and an Ancient (which we should allow to be Imitation
in One, whose Learning was not question’d) may sometimes take its Rise from
Strength of Memory, and those Impressions which he ow’d to the School. And if we
may allow a Possibility of This, considering that, when he quitted the School,
he gave into his Father’s Profession and way of Living, and had, ’tis likely,
but a slender Library of Classical Learning; and considering what a Number of
Translations, Romances, and Legends, started about his Time, and a little
before; (most of which,’tis very evident, he read;) I think, it may easily be
reconcil’d, why he rather schemed his <i>Plots</i> and <i>Charaters</i> from
these more latter Informations, than went back to those Fountains, for which he
might <span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>
entertain a sincere Veneration, but to which he could not have so ready a
Recourse.</p>

<p class = "preface">
In touching on another Part of his Learning, as it related to the Knowledge of
<i>History</i> and <i>Books</i>, I shall advance something, that, at first
sight, will very much wear the Appearance of a Paradox. For I shall find it no
hard Matter to prove, that from the grossest Blunders in History, we are not to
infer his real Ignorance of it: Nor from a greater Use of <i>Latin</i> Words,
than ever any other <i>English</i> Author used, must we infer his Knowledge of
that Language.</p>

<p class = "preface">
A Reader of Taste may easily observe, that tho’ <i>Shakespeare</i>, almost in
every Scene of his historical Plays, commits the grossest Offences against
Chronology, History, and Antient Politicks; yet This was not thro’ Ignorance, as
is generally supposed, but thro’ the too powerful Blaze of his Imagination;
which, when once raised, made all acquired Knowledge vanish and disappear before
it. For Instance, in his <i>Timon</i>, he turns <i>Athens</i>, which was a
perfect Democracy, into an Aristocracy; while he ridiculously gives a Senator
the Power of banishing <i>Alcibiades</i>. On the contrary, in <i>Coriolanus</i>,
he makes <i>Rome</i>, which at that time was a perfect Aristocracy, a Democracy
full as ridiculously, by making the People choose <i>Coriolanus</i> Consul:
Whereas, in Fact, it was not till the Time of <i>Manlius</i>
<span class = "pagenum">xxxi</span>
<i>Torquatus</i>, that the People had a Right of choosing one Consul. But this
Licence in him, as I have said, must not be imputed to Ignorance: since as often
we may find him, when Occasion serves, reasoning up to the Truth of History; and
throwing out Sentiments as justly adapted to the Circumstances of his Subject,
as to the Dignity of his Characters, or Dictates of Nature in general.</p>

<p class = "preface">
Then, to come to his Knowledge of the <i>Latin</i> Tongue, ’tis certain, there
is a surprising Effusion of <i>Latin</i> Words made <i>English</i>, far more
than in any one <i>English</i> Author I have seen; but we must be cautious to
imagine, this was of his own doing. For the <i>English</i> Tongue, in his Age,
began extremely to suffer by an Inundation of <i>Latin</i>; and to be overlaid,
as it were, by its Nurse, when it had just began to speak by her before-prudent
Care and Assistance. And this, to be sure, was occasion’d by the Pedantry of
those two Monarchs, <i>Elizabeth</i> and <i>James</i>, Both great <i>Latinists</i>.
For it is not to be wonder’d at, if both the Court and Schools, equal Flatterers
of Power, should adapt themselves to the Royal Taste. This, then, was the
Condition of the <i>English</i> Tongue when <i>Shakespeare</i> took it up: like
a Beggar in a rich Wardrobe. He found the pure native <i>English</i> too cold
and poor to second the Heat and Abundance of his Imagination: and therefore was
forc’d
<span class = "pagenum">xxxii</span>
to dress it up in the Robes, he saw provided for it: rich in themselves, but
ill-shaped; cut out to an air of Magnificence, but disproportion’d and
cumbersome. To the Costliness of Ornament, he added all the Graces and Decorum
of it. It may be said, this did not require, or discover a Knowledge of the
<i>Latin</i>. To the first, I think, it did not; to the second, it is so far
from discovering it, that, I think, it discovers the contrary. To make This more
obvious by a modern Instance: The great <span class = "extended">Milton</span>
likewise labour’d under the like Inconvenience; when he first set upon adorning
his own Tongue, he likewise animated and enrich’d it with the <i>Latin</i>, but
from his own Stock: and so, rather by bringing in the Phrases, than the Words:
And This was natural; and will, I believe, always be the Case in the same
Circumstances. His Language, especially his Prose, is full of <i>Latin</i> Words
indeed, but much fuller of <i>Latin</i> Phrases: and his Mastery in the Tongue
made this unavoidable. On the contrary, <i>Shakespeare</i>, who, perhaps, was
not so intimately vers’d in the <i>Language</i>, abounds in the Words of it, but
has few or none of its Phrases: Nor, indeed, if what I affirm be true, could He.
This I take to be the truest <i>Criterion</i> to determine this long agitated
Question.</p>

<p class = "preface">
It may be mention’d, tho’ no certain Conclusion can be drawn from it, as a
probable
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiii</span>
Argument of his having read the Antients; that He perpetually expresses the
Genius of <i>Homer</i>, and other great Poets of the Old World, in animating all
the Parts of his Descriptions; and, by bold and breathing Metaphors and Images,
giving the Properties of Life and Action to inanimate Things. He is a Copy too
of those <i>Greek</i> Masters in the infinite use of <i>compound</i> and
<i>de-compound Epithets</i>. I will not, indeed, aver, but that One with
<i>Shakespeare</i>’s exquisite Genius and Observation might have traced these
glaring Characteristics of Antiquity by reading <i>Homer</i> in <i>Chapman</i>’s
Version.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "sidenote">B. Jonson<i> and </i>Shakespeare<i> compar’d.</i></span>
An additional Word or two naturally falls in here upon the Genius of our Author,
as compared with that of <i>Jonson</i> his Contemporary. They are confessedly
the greatest Writers our Nation could ever boast of in the <i>Drama</i>. The
first, we say, owed all to his prodigious natural Genius; and the other a great
deal to his Art and Learning. This, if attended to, will explain a very
remarkable Appearance in their Writings. Besides those wonderful Masterpieces of
Art and Genius, which each has given Us; They are the Authors of other Works
very unworthy of them: But with this Difference; that in <i>Jonson</i>’s bad
Pieces we don’t discover one single Trace of the Author of the <i>Fox</i> and
<i>Alchemist</i>: but in the wild extravagant Notes of <i>Shakespeare</i>, you
every now and then encounter Strains
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiv</span>
that recognize the divine Composer. This Difference may be thus accounted for.
<i>Jonson</i>, as we said before, owing all his Excellence to his Art, by which
he sometimes strain’d himself to an uncommon Pitch, when at other times he
unbent and play’d with his Subject, having nothing then to support him, it is no
wonder he wrote so far beneath himself. But <i>Sbakespeare</i>, indebted more
largely to Nature, than the Other to acquired Talents, in his most negligent
Hours could never so totally divest himself of his Genius, but that it would
frequently break out with astonishing Force and Splendor.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "sidenote"><i>His Reputation under Disadvantages.</i></span>
As I have never propos’d to dilate farther on the Character of my Author, than
was necessary to explain the Nature and Use of this Edition, I shall proceed to
consider him as a Genius in Possession of an Everlasting Name. And how great
that Merit must be, which could gain it against all the Disadvantages of the
horrid Condition in which he has hitherto appear’d! Had <i>Homer</i>, or any
other admir’d Author, first started into Publick so, maim’d and deform’d, we
cannot determine whether they had not sunk for ever under the Ignominy of such
an ill Appearance. The mangled Condition of <i>Shakespeare</i> has been
acknowledg’d by Mr. <i>Rowe</i>, who publish’d him indeed, but neither corrected
his Text, nor collated the old Copies. This Gentleman had Abilities, and a
sufficient Knowledge of
<span class = "pagenum">xxxv</span>
his Author, had but his Industry been equal to his Talents. The same mangled
Condition has been acknowledg’d too by Mr. <i>Pope</i>, who publish’d him
likewise, pretended to have collated the old Copies, and yet seldom has
corrected the Text but to its Injury. I congratulate with the <i>Manes</i> of
our Poet, that this Gentleman has been sparing in <i>indulging his private
Sense</i>; for He, who tampers with an Author whom he does not understand, must
do it at the Expence of his Subject. I have made it evident throughout my
Remarks, that he has frequently inflicted a Wound where he intended a Cure. He
has acted with regard to our Author, as an Editor,
whom <span class = "extended">Lipsius</span>
mentions, did with regard to <span class = "extended">Martial</span>; <i>Inventus
est nescio quis </i>Popa<i>, qui non </i>vitia<i> ejus, sed </i>ipsum<i>,
excîdit.</i> He has attack’d him like an unhandy <i>Slaughterman</i>; and not
lopp’d off the <i>Errors</i>, but the <i>Poet</i>.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "sidenote"><i>Praise sometimes an Injury.</i></span>
When this is found to be the Fact, how absurd must appear the Praises of such an
Editor? It seems a moot Point, whether Mr. <i>Pope</i> has done most Injury to
<i>Shakespeare</i> as his Editor and Encomiast; or Mr. <i>Rymer</i> done him
Service as his Rival and Censurer. Were it every where the true Text, which That
Editor in his late pompous Edition gave us, the Poet deserv’d not the large
Encomiums bestow’d by him: nor, in that Case, is <i>Rymer</i>’s Censure of the
Barbarity of his Thoughts,
<span class = "pagenum">xxxvi</span>
and the Impropriety of his Expressions, groundless. They have Both shewn
themselves in an equal <i>Impuissance</i> of suspecting or amending the
corrupted Passages: and tho’ it be neither Prudence to censure, or commend, what
one does not understand; yet if a Man must do one when he plays the Critick, the
latter is the more ridiculous Office. And by That <i>Shakespeare</i> suffers
most. For the natural Veneration, which we have for him, makes us apt to swallow
whatever is given us as <i>his</i>, and let off with Encomiums; and hence we
quit all Suspicions of Depravity: On the contrary, the Censure of so divine an
Author sets us upon his Defence; and this produces an exact Scrutiny and
Examination, which ends in finding out and discriminating the true from the
spurious.</p>

<p class = "preface">
It is not with any secret Pleasure, that I so frequently animadvert on Mr.
<i>Pope</i> as a Critick; but there are Provocations, which a Man can never
quite forget. His Libels have been thrown out with so much Inveteracy, that, not
to dispute whether they <i>should</i> come from a <i>Christian</i>, they leave
it a Question whether they <i>could</i> come from a <i>Man</i>. I should be loth
to doubt, as <i>Quintus Serenus</i> did in a like Case,</p>
<div class = "verse">
<i>Sive homo, seu similis turpissima bestia nobis,<br>

</div>
<p class = "preface">
The Indignation, perhaps, for being represented a <i>Blockhead</i>, may be as
strong in Us as
<span class = "pagenum">xxxvii</span>
it is in the Ladies for a Reflexion on their <i>Beauties</i>. It is certain, I
am indebted to Him for some <i>flagrant Civilities</i>; and I shall willingly
devote a part of my Life to the honest Endeavour of quitting Scores: with this
Exception however, that I will not return those Civilities in his <i>peculiar</i>
Strain, but confine myself, at lead, to the Limits of <i>common Decency</i>. I
shall ever think it better to want <i>Wit</i>, than to want <i>Humanity</i>: and
impartial Posterity may, perhaps, be of my Opinion.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "sidenote"><ins class = "correction" title =
"exact text as in original"><i>The old Editions faulty, whence.</i></ins></span>
But, to return to my Subject; which now calls upon me to inquire into those
Causes, to which the Depravations of my Author originally may be assign’d. We
are to consider him as a Writer, of whom no authentic Manuscript was extant; as
a Writer, whose Pieces were dispersedly perform’d on the several <i>Stages</i>
then in Being. And it was the Custom of those Days for the Poets to take a Price
of the <i>Players</i> for the Pieces They from time to time furnish’d; and
thereupon it was suppos’d, they had no farther Right to print them without the
Consent of the <i>Players</i>. As it was the Interest of the <i>Companies</i> to
keep their Plays unpublish’d, when any one succeeded, there was a Contest
betwixt the Curiosity of the Town, who demanded to see it in Print, and the
Policy of the <i>Stagers</i>, who wish’d to secrete it within their own Walls.
Hence, many Pieces were taken down in Short-hand, and imperfectly copied
<span class = "pagenum">xxxviii</span>
by Ear, from a <i>Representation</i>: Others were printed from piece-meal Parts,
surreptitiously obtain’d from the Theatres, uncorrect, and without the Poet’s
Knowledge. To some of these Causes we owe the train of Blemishes, that deform
those Pieces which stole singly into the World in our Author’s Life-time.</p>

<p class = "preface">
There are still other Reasons, which may be suppos’d to have affected the whole
Set. When the <i>Players</i> took upon them to publish his Works intire, every
Theatre was ransack’d to supply the Copy; and <i>Parts</i> collected which had
gone thro’ as many Changes as Performers, either from Mutilations or Additions
made to them. Hence we derive many Chasms and Incoherences in the Sense and
Matter. Scenes were frequently transposed, and shuffled out of their true Place,
to humour the Caprice or suppos’d Convenience of some particular Actor. Hence
much Confusion and Impropriety has attended, and embarras’d, the Business and
Fable. For there ever have been, and ever will be in Playhouses, a Set of
assuming Directors, who know better than the Poet himself the Connexion and
Dependance of his Scenes; where Matter is defective, or Superfluities to be
retrench’d; Persons, that have the Fountain of <i>Inspiration</i> as peremptorily
in them, as Kings have That of <i>Honour</i>. To these obvious Causes of
Corruption it must be added, that our Author has lain under the Disadvantage
<span class = "pagenum">xxxix<br>c</span>
of having his Errors propagated and multiplied by Time: because, for near a
Century; his Works were republish’d from the faulty Copies without the
assistance of any intelligent Editor: which has been the Case likewise of many a
<i>Classic</i> Writer.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "sidenote"><i>The Editor’s Drift and Method.</i></span>
The Nature of any Distemper once found has generally been the immediate Step to
a Cure. <i>Shakespeare</i>’s Case has in a great Measure resembled That of a
corrupt <i>Classic</i>; and, consequently, the Method of Cure was likewise to
bear a Resemblance. By what Means, and with what Success, this Cure has been
effected on ancient Writers, is too well known, and needs no formal Illustration.
The Reputation consequent on Tasks of that Nature invited me to attempt the
Method here; with this View, the Hopes of restoring to the Publick their
greatest Poet in his Original Purity: after having so long lain in a Condition
that was a Disgrace to common Sense. To this End I have ventur’d on a Labour,
that is the first Assay of the kind on any modern Author whatsoever. For the
late Edition of <i>Milton</i> by the Learned
<span class = "sidenote"><i>Difference betwixt this Edition and Dr. </i>Bentley<i>’s
</i>Milton<i>.</i></span>
Dr. <i>Bentley</i> is, in the main, a Performance of another Species. It is
plain, it was the Intention of that Great Man rather to Correct and pare off the
Excrescencies of the <i>Paradise Lost</i>, in the manner that <i>Tucca</i> and
<i>Varius</i> were employ’d to criticize the <i>Æneis</i> of <i>Virgil</i>, than
to restore corrupted Passages. Hence, therefore,
<span class = "pagenum">xl</span>
may be seen either the Iniquity or Ignorance of his Censurers, who, from some
Expressions, would make us believe, the <i>Doctor</i> every where gives us his
Corrections as the Original Text of the Author; whereas the chief Turn of his
Criticism is plainly to shew the World, that if <i>Milton</i> did not write as
He would have him, he ought to have wrote so.</p>

<p class = "preface">
I thought proper to premise this Observation to the Readers, as it will shew
that the Critic on <i>Shakespeare</i> is of a quite different Kind. His genuine
Text is religiously adher’d to, and the numerous Faults and Blemishes, purely
his own, are left as they were found. Nothing is alter’d, but what by the
clearest Reasoning can be proved a Corruption of the true Text; and the
Alteration, a real Restoration of the genuine Reading. Nay, so strictly have I
strove to give the true Reading, tho’ sometimes not to the Advantage of my
Author, that I have been ridiculously ridicul’d for it by Those, who either were
iniquitously for turning every thing to my Disadvantage; or else were totally
ignorant of the true Duty of an Editor.</p>

<p class = "preface">
The Science of Criticism, as far as it affects an Editor, seems to be reduced to
these three Classes; the Emendation of corrupt Passages; the Explanation of
obscure and difficult ones; and an Inquiry into the Beauties and Defects of
Composition. This Work
<span class = "pagenum">xli<br>c2</span>
is principally confin’d to the two former Parts: tho’ there are some Specimens
interspers’d of the latter Kind, as several of the Emendations were best
supported, and several of the Difficulties best explain’d, by taking notice of
the Beauties and Defects of the Composition peculiar to this Immortal Poet. But
This was but occasional, and for the sake only of perfecting the two other
Parts, which were the proper Objects of the Editor’s Labour. The third lies open
for every willing Undertaker: and I shall be pleas’d to see it the Employment of
a masterly Pen.</p>

<p class = "preface">
It must necessarily happen, as I have formerly observ’d, that where the
Assistance of Manuscripts is wanting to set an Author’s Meaning right, and
rescue him from those Errors which have been transmitted down thro’ a Series of
incorrect Editions, and a long Intervention of Time, many Passages must be
desperate, and past a Cure; and their true Sense irretrievable either to Care or
the Sagacity of Conjecture. But is there any Reason therefore to say, That
because All cannot be retriev’d, All ought to be left desperate? We should shew
very little Honesty, or Wisdom, to play the Tyrants with an Author’s Text; to
raze, alter, innovate, and overturn, at all Adventures, and to the utter
Detriment of his Sense and Meaning: But to be so very reserved and cautious, as
to interpose no
<span class = "pagenum">xlii</span>
Relief or Conjecture, where it manifestly labours and cries out for Assistance,
seems, on the other hand, an indolent Absurdity.</p>

<p class = "preface">
But because the Art of Criticism, both by Those who cannot form a true Judgment
of its Effects, nor can penetrate into its Causes, <ins class = "correction"
title = "opening '(' invisible in original">(which</ins> takes in a great Number
besides the Ladies;) is esteem’d only an arbitrary capricious Tyranny exercis’d
on Books; I think proper to subjoin a Word or two about those Rules on which I
have proceeded, and by which I have regulated myself in this Edition. By This, I
flatter myself, it will appear, my Emendations are so far from being arbitrary
or capricious, that They are establish’d with a very high Degree of moral
Certainty.</p>

<p class = "preface">
As there are very few Pages in <i>Shakespeare,</i> upon which some Suspicions of
Depravity do not reasonably arise; I have thought it my Duty, in the first
place, by a diligent and laborious Collation to take in the Assistances of all
the older Copies.</p>

<p class = "preface">
In his <i>Historical Plays</i>, whenever our <i>English</i> Chronicles, and in
his Tragedies when <i>Greek</i> or <i>Roman</i> Story, could give any Light; no
Pains have been omitted to set Passages right by comparing my Author with his
Originals: for, as I have frequently observed, he was a close and accurate
Copier where-ever his <i>Fable</i> was founded on <i>History</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xliii<br>c3</span>
<p class = "preface">
Where-ever the Author’s Sense is clear and discoverable, (tho’, perchance, low
and trivial;) I have not by any Innovation tamper’d with his Text; out of an
Ostentation of endeavouring to make him speak better than the Old Copies have
done.</p>

<p class = "preface">
Where, thro’ all the former Editions, a Passage has labour’d under flat Nonsense
and invincible Darkness, if, by the Addition or Alteration of a Letter or two, I
have restored to Him both Sense and Sentiment, such Corrections, I am persuaded,
will need no Indulgence.</p>

<p class = "preface">
And whenever I have taken a greater Latitude and Liberty in amending, I have
constantly endeavoured to support my Corrections and Conjectures by parallel
Passages and Authorities from himself, the surest Means of expounding any Author
whatsoever. <i>Cette voïe d’interpreter un Autheur par lui-même est plus sure
que tous les Commentaires</i>, says a very learned <i>French</i> Critick.</p>

<p class = "preface">
As to my <i>Notes</i>, (from which the common and learned Readers of our Author,
I hope, will derive some Pleasure;) I have endeavour’d to give them a Variety in
some Proportion to their Number. Where-ever I have ventur’d at an Emendation, a
<i>Note</i> is constantly subjoin’d to justify and assert the Reason of it.
Where I only offer a Conjecture, and do not disturb the Text, I fairly set forth
my Grounds for such Conjecture, and submit it
<span class = "pagenum">xliv</span>
to Judgment. Some Remarks are spent in explaining Passages, Where the Wit or
Satire depends on an obscure Point of History: Others, where Allusions are to
Divinity, Philosophy, or other Branches of Science. Some are added to shew,
where there is a Suspicion of our Author having borrowed from the Antients:
Others, to shew where he is rallying his Contemporaries; or where He himself is
rallied by them. And some are necessarily thrown in, to explain an obscure and
obsolete <i>Term</i>, <i>Phrase</i>, or <i>Idea</i>. I once intended to have
added a complete and copious <i>Glossary</i>; but as I have been importun’d, and
am prepar’d, to give a correct Edition of our Author’s
<span class = "extended">Poems</span>,
(in which many Terms occur that are not to be met with in his <i>Plays</i>,) I
thought a <i>Glossary</i> to all <i>Shakespeare</i>’s Works more proper to
attend that Volume.</p>

<p class = "preface">
In reforming an infinite Number of Passages in the <i>Pointing</i>, where the
Sense was before quite lost, I have frequently subjoin’d Notes to shew the
<i>deprav’d</i>, and to prove the <i>reform’d</i>, Pointing: a Part of Labour in
this Work which I could very willingly have spared myself. May it not be
objected, why then have you burthen’d us with these Notes? The Answer is
obvious, and, if I mistake not, very material. Without such Notes, these
Passages in subsequent Editions would be liable, thro’ the Ignorance of Printers
and Correctors, to fall into the old Confusion: Whereas,
<span class = "pagenum">xlv<br>c4</span>
a Note on every one hinders all possible Return to Depravity; and for ever
secures them in a State of Purity and Integrity not to be lost or forfeited.</p>

<p class = "preface">
Again, as some Notes have been necessary to point out the Detection of the
corrupted Text, and establish the Reiteration of the genuine Readings; some
others have been as necessary for the Explanation of Passages obscure and
difficult.
<span class = "sidenote"><i>Causes of Obscurities in </i>Shakespeare<i>.</i></span>
To understand the Necessity and Use of this Part of my Task, some Particulars of
my Author’s Character are previously to be explain’d. There are <i>Obscurities</i>
in him, which are common to him with all Poets of the same Species; there are
Others, the Issue of the Times he liv’d in; and there are Others, again,
peculiar to himself. The Nature of Comic Poetry being entirely satyrical, it
busies itself more in exposing what we call Caprice and Humour, than Vices
cognizable to the Laws. The <i>English</i>, from the Happiness of a free
Constitution, and a Turn of Mind peculiarly speculative and inquisitive, are
observ’d to produce more <i>Humourists</i> and a greater Variety of Original
<i>Characters</i>, than any other People whatsoever: And These owing their
immediate Birth to the peculiar Genius of each Age, an infinite Number of Things
alluded to, glanced at, and expos’d, must needs become obscure, as the
<i>Characters</i> themselves are antiquated, and disused. An Editor therefore
should be well vers’d in the
<span class = "pagenum">xlvi</span>
History and Manners of his Author’s Age, if he aims at doing him a Service in
this Respect.</p>

<p class = "preface">
Besides, <i>Wit</i> lying mostly in the Assemblage of <i>Ideas</i>, and in the
putting Those together with Quickness and Variety, wherein can be found any
Resemblance, or Congruity, to make up pleasant Pictures, and agreeable Visions
in the Fancy; the Writer, who aims at Wit, must of course range far and wide for
Materials. Now, the Age, in which <i>Shakespeare</i> liv’d, having, above all
others, a wonderful Affection to appear Learned, They declined vulgar Images,
such as are immediately fetch’d from Nature, and rang’d thro’ the Circle of the
Sciences to fetch their Ideas from thence. But as the Resemblances of such Ideas
to the Subject must necessarily lie very much out of the common Way, and every
piece of Wit appear a Riddle to the Vulgar; This, that should have taught them
the forced, quaint, unnatural Tract they were in, (and induce them to follow a
more natural One,) was the very Thing that kept them attach’d to it. The
ostentatious Affectation of abstruse Learning, peculiar to that Time, the Love
that Men naturally have to every Thing that looks like Mystery, fixed them down
to this Habit of Obscurity. Thus became the Poetry of
<span class = "extended">Donne</span>
(tho’ the wittiest Man of that Age,) nothing but a continued Heap of Riddles.
And our <i>Shakespeare</i>, with all his
<span class = "pagenum">xlvii</span>
easy Nature about him, for want of the Knowledge of the true Rules of Art, falls
frequently into this vicious Manner.</p>

<p class = "preface">
The third Species of <i>Obscurities</i>, which deform our Author, as the Effects
of his own Genius and Character, are Those that proceed from his peculiar Manner
of <i>Thinking</i>, and as peculiar a Manner of <i>cloathing</i> those
<i>Thoughts</i>. With regard to his <i>Thinking</i>, it is certain, that he had
a general Knowledge of all the Sciences: But his Acquaintance was rather That of
a Traveller, than a Native. Nothing in Philosophy was unknown to him; but every
Thing in it had the Grace and Force of Novelty. And as Novelty is one main
Source of Admiration, we are not to wonder that He has perpetual Allusions to
the most recondite Parts of the Sciences: and This was done not so much out of
Affectation, as the Effect of Admiration begot by Novelty. Then, as to his
<i>Style</i> and <i>Diction</i>, we may much more justly apply to <span class =
"extended">Shakespeare</span>, what a celebrated Writer has said of <span class
= "extended">Milton</span>; <i>Our Language sunk under him, and was unequal to
that Greatness of Soul which furnish’d him with such glorious Conceptions</i>.
He therefore frequently uses old Words, to give his Diction an Air of Solemnity;
as he coins others, to express the Novelty and Variety of his Ideas.</p>

<p class = "preface">
Upon every distinct Species of these <i>Obscurities</i> I have thought it my
Province to employ a Note, for the Service of my Author,
<span class = "pagenum">xlviii</span>
and the Entertainment of my Readers. A few transient Remarks too I have not
scrupled to intermix, upon the Poet’s <i>Negligences</i> and <i>Omissions</i> in
point of Art; but I have done it always in such a Manner, as will testify my
Deference and Veneration for the Immortal Author. Some Censurers of <i>Shakespeare</i>,
and particularly Mr. <i>Rymer</i>, have taught me to distinguish betwixt the
<i>Railer</i> and <i>Critick</i>. The Outrage of his Quotations is so remarkably
violent, so push’d beyond all Bounds of Decency and sober Reasoning, that it
quite carries over the Mark at which it was levell’d. Extravagant Abuse throws
off the Edge of the intended Disparagement, and turns the Madman’s Weapon into
his own Bosom. In short, as to <i>Rymer</i>, This is my Opinion of him from his
<i>Criticisms</i> on the <i>Tragedies</i> of the Last Age. He writes with great
Vivacity, and appears to have been a Scholar: but, as for his Knowledge of the
Art of Poetry, I can’t perceive it was any deeper than his Acquaintance with
<i>Bossu</i> and <i>Dacier</i>, from whom he has transcribed many of his best
Reflexions. The late Mr. <i>Gildon</i> was One attached to <i>Rymer</i> by a
similar Way of Thinking and Studies. They were Both of that Species of Criticks,
who are desirous of displaying their Powers rather in finding Faults, than in
consulting the Improvement of the World: the <i>hypercritical</i> Part of the
Science of <i>Criticism</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xlix</span>
<p class = "preface">
I had not mentioned the modest Liberty I have here and there taken of animadverting
on my Author, but that I was willing to obviate in time the splenetick
Exaggerations of my Adversaries on this Head. From past Experiments I have
Reason to be conscious, in what Light this Attempt may be placed: and that what
I call a <i>modest Liberty</i>, will, by a little of their Dexterity, be
inverted into downright <i>Impudence</i>. From a hundred mean and dishonest
Artifices employ’d to discredit this Edition, and to cry down its Editor, I have
all the Grounds in Nature to be aware of Attacks. But tho’ the Malice of Wit
join’d to the Smoothness of Versification may furnish some Ridicule; Fact, I
hope, will be able to stand its Ground against Banter and Gaiety.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "sidenote">Shakespeare<i>’s Anachronisms defended.</i></span>
It has been my Fate, it seems, as I thought it my Duty, to discover some
<i>Anachronisms</i> in our Author; which might have slept in Obscurity but for
<i>this Restorer</i>, as Mr. <i>Pope</i> is pleas’d affectionately to style me;
as, for Instance, where <i>Aristotle</i> is mentioned by <i>Hector</i> in
<i>Troilus</i> and <i>Cressida</i>: and <i>Galen</i>, <i>Cato</i>, and
<i>Alexander</i> the Great, in <i>Coriolanus</i>. These, in Mr. <i>Pope</i>’s
Opinion, are Blunders, which the Illiteracy of the first Publishers of his Works
has father’d upon the Poet’s Memory: <i>it not being at all credible, that These
could be the Errors of any Man who had the least Tincture of a School, or the
least Conversation with</i>
<span class = "pagenum">l</span>
<i>such as had.</i> But I have sufficiently proved, in the Course of my
<i>Notes</i>, that such Anachronisms were the Effect of poetic Licence, rather
than of Ignorance in our Poet. And if I may be permitted to ask a modest
Question by the way,
<span class = "sidenote"><i>Mr. </i>Pope<i>’s Anachronisms examin’d.</i></span>
Why may not I restore an Anachronism really made by our Author, as well as Mr.
<i>Pope</i> take the Privilege to fix others upon him, which he never had it in
his Head to make; as I may venture to affirm He had not, in the Instance of Sir
<i>Francis Drake</i>, to which I have spoke in the proper Place?</p>

<p class = "preface">
But who shall dare make any Words about this Freedom of Mr. <i>Pope</i>’s
towards <i>Shakespeare</i>, if it can be prov’d, that, in his Fits of Criticism,
he makes no more Ceremony with good <i>Homer</i> himself? To try, then, a
Criticism of his own advancing; In the 8th Book of the <i>Odyssey</i>, where
<i>Demodocus</i> sings the Episode of the Loves of <i>Mars</i> and <i>Venus</i>;
and that, upon their being taken in the Net by <i>Vulcan</i>,</p>
<div class = "verse">
&mdash;&mdash;<i>the God of Arms<br>
Must pay the Penalty for lawless Charms;</i>
</div>
<p class = "preface">
Mr. <i>Pope</i> is so kind gravely to inform us, “That <i>Homer</i> in This, as
in many other Places, seems to allude to the Laws of <i>Athens</i>, where Death
was the Punishment of Adultery.” But how is this significant Observation made
out? Why, who can possibly object any Thing to the Contrary?&mdash;<i>Does
not</i>
<span class = "pagenum">li</span>
Pausanias<i> relate, that </i>Draco<i> the Lawgiver to the </i>Athenians<i>
granted Impunity to any Person that took Revenge upon an Adulterer? And was it
not also the Institution of </i>Solon<i>, that if Any One took an Adulterer in
the Fact, he might use him as he pleas’d?</i> These Things are very true: and to
see What a good Memory, and sound Judgment in Conjunction can atchieve! Tho’
<i>Homer</i>’s Date is not determin’d down to a single Year, yet ’tis pretty
generally agreed that he liv’d above 300 Years before <i>Draco</i> and
<i>Solon</i>: And That, it seems, has made him <i>seem</i> to allude to the very
Laws, which these Two Legislators propounded above 300 Years after. If this
Inference be not something like an <i>Anachronism</i> or <i>Prolepsis</i>, I’ll
look once more into my Lexicons for the true Meaning of the Words. It appears to
me, that somebody besides <i>Mars</i> and <i>Venus</i> has been caught in a Net
by this Episode: and I could call in other Instances to confirm what treacherous
Tackle this Network is, if not cautiously handled.</p>

<p class = "preface">
How just, notwithstanding, I have been in detecting the Anachronisms of my
Author, and in defending him for the Use of them, Our late Editor seems to
think, They should rather have slept in Obscurity: and the having discovered
them is sneer’d at, as a sort of wrong-headed Sagacity.</p>

<p class = "preface">
The numerous Corrections, which I made of the Poet’s Text in my <span class =
"extended">Shakespeare</span>
<span class = "pagenum">lii</span>
<i>Restor’d</i>, and which the Publick have been so kind to think well of, are,
in the Appendix of Mr. <i>Pope</i>’s last Edition, slightingly call’d <i>Various
Readings</i>, <i>Guesses</i>, &amp;c. He confesses to have inserted as many of
them as he judg’d of any the least Advantage to the Poet; but says, that the
Whole amounted to about 25 Words: and pretends to have annexed a compleat List
of the Rest, which were not worth his embracing. Whoever has read my Book will
at one glance see, how in both these Points Veracity is strain’d, so an Injury
might but be done. <i>Malus etsi obesse non pote, tamen cogitat</i>.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "sidenote">Literal Criticism<i> defended.</i></span>
Another Expedient, to make my Work appear of a trifling Nature, has been an
Attempt to depreciate <i>Literal Criticism</i>. To this End, and to pay a
servile Compliment to Mr. <i>Pope</i>, an <i>Anonymous</i> Writer has, like a
<i>Scotch</i> Pedlar in Wit, unbraced his Pack on the Subject. But, that his
Virulence might not seem to be levelled singly at Me, he has done Me the Honour
to join Dr. <i>Bentley</i> in the Libel. I was in hopes, We should have been
Both abused with Smartness of Satire, at least; tho’ not with Solidity of
Argument: that it might have been worth some Reply in Defence of the Science
attacked. But I may fairly say of this Author, as <i>Falstaffe</i> does of
<i>Poins</i>;&mdash;<i>Hang him, Baboon! his Wit is as thick as </i>Tewksbury<i>
Mustard; there is no more Conceit in him, than is in a</i> <span class =

If it be not Prophanation to set the Opinion of the divine <i>Longinus</i>
against such a Scribler, he tells us expresly, “That to make a Judgment upon
<i>Words</i> (and <i>Writings</i>) is the most consummate Fruit of much
Experience.” <span class = "greek">ἡ γὰρ τῶν λόγων κρίσις πολλῆς ἐστὶ πείρας
τελευταῖον ἐπιγέννημα.</span> Whenever Words are depraved, the Sense of course
must be corrupted; and thence the Readers betray’d into a false Meaning. Tho’ I
should be convicted of Pedantry by some, I’ll venture to subjoin a few flagrant
Instances, in which I have observed most Learned Men have suffer’d themselves to
be deceived, and consequently led their Readers into Error: and This for want of
the Help of <i>Literal Criticism</i>: in some, thro’ Indolence and Inadvertence:
in others, perhaps, thro’ an absolute Contempt of It. If the <i>Subject</i> may
seem to invite this Digression, I hope, the <i>Use</i> and <i>Application</i>
will serve to excuse it.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<a name = "greek"> </a><br>
<span class = "sidenote">Platonius<i> corrected.</i></span>
I. In that golden Fragment, which we have left of <i>Platonius</i>, upon the
three Kinds of <i>Greek</i> Comedy, after he has told us, that when the State of
<i>Athens</i> was alter’d from a Democracy to an Oligarchy, and that the Poets
grew cautious whom they libell’d in their Comedies; when the People had no
longer any Desire to choose the accustom’d Officers for furnishing <i>Choric</i>
Singers, and defraying the Expence of them, <i>Aristophanes</i> brought on a
Play in which there was no <i>Chorus</i>. For,
<span class = "pagenum">liv</span>
subjoins He, <span class = "greek">τῶν γὰρ ΧΟΡΕΥΤΩΝ μὴ
χειροτονουμένων, καὶ τῶν ΧΟΡΗΓΩΝ οὐκ ἐχόντων τὰς τροφὰς,
ὑπεξῃρέθη τῆς Κωμῳδίας τὰ χορικὰ μέλη, καὶ τῶν ὑποθέσεων ὁ
τρόπος μετεβλήθη.</span> <i>“The </i>Chorus-Singers<i> being no longer chosen by
Suffrage, and the </i>Furnishers<i> of the</i> Chorus <i>no longer having their
Maintenance, the </i>Choric<i> Songs were taken out of Comedies, and the Nature
of the Argument and Fable chang’d.</i>” But there happen to be two signal
Mistakes in this short Sentence. For the <i>Chorus-Singers</i> were never
elected by Suffrage at all, but hir’d by the proper Officer who was at the
Expence of the <i>Chorus</i>: and the <i>Furnishers</i> of the <i>Chorus</i> had
never either Table, or Stipend, allowed them, towards their Charge. To what
Purpose then is this Sentence, which should be a Deduction from the Premises,
and yet is none, brought in? Or how comes the Reasoning to be founded upon what
was not the Fact? The Mistake manifestly arises from a careless Transposition
made in the Text: Let the two <i>Greek</i> Words, which I have distinguished by
<i>Capitals</i>, only change Places, and we recover what <i>Platonius</i> meant
to infer:
<span class = "footnote">A: <span class = "greek">Χορηγῶν.</span><br>
B: <span class = "greek">Χορευτῶν.</span></span>
“That the <sup>A</sup><i>Furnishers</i> of <i>Chorus</i>’s being no longer
elected by Suffrage, and the <sup>B</sup><i>Chorus-Singers</i> having no
Provision made for them, <i>Chorus</i>’s were abolished, and the Subjects of
Comedies alter’d.”</p>

<p class = "preface">
II. There is another more egregious Error still subsisting in this instructive
Fragment,
<span class = "pagenum">lv<br>d</span>
which has likewise escaped the Notice of the Learned. The Author is saying,
that, in the <i>old Comedy</i>, the <i>Masks</i> were made so nearly to resemble
the Persons to be satirized, that before the Actor spoke a Word, it was known
whom he was to personate. But, in the <i>New Comedy</i>, when <i>Athens</i> was
conquered by the <i>Macedonians</i>, and the Poets were fearful lest their Masks
should be construed to resemble any of their New Governors, they formed them so
preposterously as only to move Laughter; <span class = "greek">ὁρῶμεν γοῦν</span>
(says He) <span class = "greek">τὰς
ὀφρῦς ἐν τοῖς προσώποις τῆς Μενάνδρου κωμῳδίας ὁποίας ἔχει, καὶ
ὅπως ἐξεστραμμένον τὸ ΣΩΜΑ. καὶ οὐδε κατὰ ἀνθρώπων φύσιν.</span> “<i>We see
therefore what strange Eyebrows there are to the Masks used in</i> Menander<i>’s
Comedies; and how the </i>Body<i> is distorted, and unlike any human Creature
alive</i>.” But the Author, ’tis evident, is speaking abstractedly of <i>Masks</i>;
and what Reference has the <i>Distortion</i> of the <i>Body</i> to the Look <ins
class = "correction" title = "'f' invisible in original">of</ins> a <i>Visor</i>?
I am satisfied, <i>Platonius</i> wrote; <span class = "greek">καὶ ὅπως
ἐξεστραμμένον τὸ ὌΜΜΑ</span>, <i>i.e.</i> “and how the <i>Eyes</i> were
<i>goggled</i> and <i>distorted</i>.” This is to the Purpose of his Subject: and
<i>Jul. Pollux</i>, in describing the Comic Masques, speaks of some that had
<span class = "greek">ΣΤΡΕΒΛΟΝ τὸ ὌΜΜΑ</span>: Others, that were <span class =

<span class = "sidenote">Camerarius<i> and </i>Keuster<i>, mistaken.</i></span>
III. <i>Suidas</i>, in the short Account that he has given us of <i>Sophocles</i>,
tells us, that,
<span class = "pagenum">lvi</span>
besides Dramatic Pieces, he wrote Hymns and Elegies; <span class = "greek">καὶ
λόγον καταλογάδην περὶ τοῦ Χοροῦ πρὸς Θέσπιν καὶ
Χοίριλον ἀγωνιζόμενος</span>. This the Learned <i>Camerarius</i> has thus
translated: <i>Scripsit Oratione solutâ de </i>Choro<i> contra </i>Thespin<i>
&amp; </i>Choerilum<i> quempiam.</i> And <i>Keuster</i> likewise understood, and
render’d, the Passage to the same Effect. He owns, the Place is obscure, and
suspected by him. “<i>For how could </i>Sophocles<i> contend with </i>Thespis<i>
and </i>Choerilus<i>, who liv’d long before his Time?</i>” The Scholiast
upon
<span class = "footnote">C: In Ranis, v. 73.</span>
<sup>C</sup><i>Aristophanes</i>, however, expresly says, as <i>Keuster</i> might
have remember’d, that <i>Sophocles</i> actually did contend with <i>Choerilus</i>.
But that is a Point nothing to the Passage in Question; which means, as I have
shewn in another Place, <i>That </i>Sophocles<i> declaimed in Prose, contending
to obtain a </i>Chorus<i> for reviving some Pieces of </i>Thespis<i> and
</i>Choerilus<i>.</i> Is This contending against Them, as rival Poets?</p>

<span class = "sidenote">Meursius<i>, and </i>Camerarius<i> mistaken</i>.</span>
IV. Some other Learned Men have likewise been mistaken in Particulars with
regard to <i>Sophocles</i>. In the Synopsis of his Life, we find these Words;
<span class = "greek">Τελευτᾶ δὲ μετὰ
Ἐυριπίδην ἐτῶν ϛ’.</span> <i>Meursius</i>, as well as <i>Camerarius</i>, have
expounded This, as if <i>Sophocles</i> surviv’d <i>Euripides</i> six Years. But
the best Accounts agree that they died both in the same Year, a little before
the <i>Frogs</i> of <i>Aristophanes</i> was play’d; <i>scil.</i> Olymp. 93, 3.
The Meaning, therefore, of the Passage is, as some of the
<span class = "pagenum">lvii<br>d2</span>
Commentators have rightly observ’d; <i>That </i>Sophocles<i> died after
</i>Euripides<i>, at 90 Years of Age.</i> The Mistake arose from hence, that, in

<span class = "sidenote"><i>Father </i>Brumoy<i> mistaken.</i></span>
V. The Learned Father <i>Brumoy</i> too, who has lately given us three Volumes
upon the <i>Theatre</i> of the <i>Greeks</i>, has slipt into an Error about
<i>Sophocles</i>; for, speaking of his <i>Antigone</i>, he tells us, it was in
such Request as to be perform’d Two and Thirty times; <i>Elle fût representée
trente deux fois.</i> The Account, on which This is grounded, we have from the
Argument prefix’d to <i>Antigone</i> by <i>Aristophanes</i> the Grammarian: and
the <i>Latin</i> Translator of this Argument, probably, led Father <i>Brumoy</i>
into his Mistake, and he should have referr’d to the Original. The <i>Greek</i>
Words are; <span class = "greek">λέλεκται δὲ τὸ δρᾶμα τοῦτο τριακοστὸν

The Mistakes, that I have mentioned, (tho’ they necessarily lead into Error,
from the Authority with which they come into the World;) yet are such, ’tis
obvious, as have been the Effects of Inadvertence; and therefore I do not quote
them to the Dishonour of their Learned Authors. I shall point out Two or Three,

an absolute Neglect of <i>literal Criticism</i>.

VIII. I come now to the <i>Votive Table</i>, which is rich in poetick Graces,
however overwhelm’d with Depravation: and Sir <i>George</i> seems as much to
have mistaken the Purport, as the Words, of the Inscription. <i>At </i>Chalcedon<i>,
</i>says he<i>, I found an Inscription in the Wall of a private House near the
Church; which signifieth, that </i>Evante<i>, the Son of </i>Antipater<i>,
having made a prosperous Voyage, and desiring to return by the </i>Ægean<i> Sea,
offered Cakes at a Statue, which he had erected to </i>Jupiter<i>, which had
sent him such good Weather, as a Token of his good Voyage.</i></p>

I have mark’d, as before, my Corrections at the Side; and I may venture to say,
I have supported the faltring Verses both with <i>Numbers</i> and <i>Sense</i>.
But who ever heard of <i>Evante</i>, as the Name of a Man, in <i>Greece</i>?
Neither is this Inscription a Piece of Ethnic Devotion, as Sir <i>George</i> has
suppos’d it, to a Statue erected to <i>Jupiter</i>: On the contrary, it despises
those fruitless Superstitions. <i>Philo</i> (a <i>Christian</i>, as it seems to
me;) sets it up, in Thanks for a safe Voyage, to the <i>true God</i>. That all
my Readers may equally share in this little Poem, I have attempted to put it
into an <i>English</i> Dress.</p>

I shall have no Occasion, I believe, to ask the Pardon of <i>some</i> Readers
for these <i>Nine</i> last Pages; and Others may be so kind to pass them over at
their Pleasure. (Those Discoveries, which give Light and Satisfaction to
<span class = "pagenum">lxii</span>
the truly Learned, I must confess, are Darkness and Mystery to the less capable:
<span class = "greek">Φέγγος μὲν ξυνετοῖς, ἀξυνετοῖς
δ᾽ Ἐρεβος</span>.) Nor will they be absolutely foreign, I hope, to a Preface in
some Measure critical; especially, as it could not be amiss to shew, that I have
read other Books with the same Accuracy, with which I profess to have read
<i>Shakespeare</i>. Besides, I design’d this Inference from the Defence of
Literal Criticism. If the <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i> Languages have receiv’d
the greatest Advantages imaginable from the Labours of the Editors and Criticks
of the two last Ages; by whose Aid and Assistance the Grammarians have been
enabled to write infinitely better in that Art than even the preceding
Grammarians, who wrote when those Tongues flourish’d as living Languages: I
should account it a peculiar Happiness, that, by the faint Assay I have made in
this Work, a Path might be chalk’d out, for abler Hands, by which to derive the
same Advantages to our own Tongue: a Tongue, which, tho’ it wants none of the
fundamental Qualities of an universal Language, yet as a <i>noble Writer</i>
says, lisps and stammers as in its Cradle; and has produced little more towards
its polishing than Complaints of its Barbarity.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "footnote"><i>The Delay of this Edition excused.</i></span>
Having now run thro’ all those Points, which I intended should make any Part of
this Dissertation, it only remains, that I should account to the Publick, but
more particularly to
<span class = "pagenum">lxiii</span>
my Subscribers, why they have waited so long for this Work; that I should make
my Acknowledgments to those Friends, who have been generous Assistants to me in
the conducting it: and, lastly, that I should acquaint my Readers what Pains I
have myself taken to make the Work as complete, as faithful Industry, and my
best Abilities, could render it.</p>

<p class = "preface">
In the middle of the Year 1728, I first put out my <i>Proposals</i> for
publishing only <i>Emendations</i> and <i>Remarks</i> on our Poet: and I had not
gone on many Months in this Scheme, before I found it to be the unanimous Wish
of those who did me the Honour of their Subscriptions, that I would give them
the Poet’s Text corrected; and that I would subjoin those Explanatory Remarks,
which I had purpos’d to publish upon the Foot of my first Proposals. Earnest
Sollicitations were made to me, that I would think of such an Edition; which I
had as strong Desires to listen to: and some <i>noble</i> Persons then, whom I
have no Privilege to name, were pleased to interest themselves so far in the
Affair, as to propose to Mr. <i>Tonson</i> his undertaking an Impression of
<i>Shakespeare</i> with my Corrections. The throwing my whole Work into a
different Form, to comply with this Proposal, was not the slightest Labour: and
so no little Time was unavoidably lost. While the Publication of my Remarks was
thus respited, my
<span class = "pagenum">lxiv</span>
Enemies took an unfair Occasion to suggest, that I was extorting Money from my
Subscribers, without ever designing to give them any Thing for it: an Insinuation
levell’d at once to wound me in Reputation and Interest. Conscious, however, of
my own just Intentions, and labouring all the while to bring my wish’d Purpose
to bear, I thought these anonymous Slanderers worthy of no Notice. A Justification
of myself would have been giving them Argument for fresh Abuse; and I was
willing to believe that any unkind Opinions, entertain’d to my Prejudice, would
naturally drop and lose their Force, when the Publick should once be convinc’d
that I was in Earnest, and ready to do them Justice. I left no Means untry’d to
put it in my Power to do this: and I hope, without Breach of Modesty, I may
venture to appeal to all candid Judges, whether I have not employ’d all my Power
to be just to them in the Execution of my Task. I must needs have been in the
most Pain, who saw myself daily so barbarously outraged. I might have taken
advantage of the favourable Impressions entertain’d of my Work, and hurried it
crudely into the World: But I have suffer’d, for my Author’s sake, those
Impressions to cool, and perhaps, be lost; and can now appeal only to the
<i>Judgment</i> of the Publick. If I succeed in this Point, the Reputation
gain’d will be the more solid and lasting.
<span class = "pagenum">lxv</span>
<span class = "footnote"><i>Acknowledgment of Assistance.</i></span>
I come now to speak of those kind Assistances which I have met with from
particular Friends, towards forwarding and compleating this Work. Soon after my
Design was known, I had the Honour of an Invitation to <i>Cambridge</i>; and a
generous Promise from the Learned and ingenious Dr. <i>Thirlby</i>
of <i>Jesus</i>-College,
there, who had taken great Pains with my Author, that I should have the Liberty
of collating his Copy of <i>Shakespeare</i>, mark’d thro’ in the Margin with his
own Manuscript References and accurate Observations. He not only made good this
Promise, but favour’d me with a Set of Emendations, interspers’d and distinguish’d
in his Name thro’ the Edition, and which can need no Recommendation here to the
judicious Reader.</p>

<p class = "preface">
The next Assistance I receiv’d was from my ingenious Friend <i>Hawley Bishop</i>
Esq; whose great Powers and extensive Learning are as well known, as his
uncommon Modesty, to all who have the Happiness of his Acquaintance. This
Gentleman was so generous, at the Expence both of his Pocket and Time, to run
thro’ all <i>Shakespeare</i> with me. We join’d Business and Entertainment
together; and at every of our Meetings, which were constantly once a Week, we
read over a <i>Play</i>, and came mutually prepar’d to communicate our
Conjectures upon it to each other. The Pleasure of these Appointments,
I
<span class = "pagenum">lxvi</span>
think, I may say, richly compensated for the Labour in our own Thoughts: and I
may venture to affirm, in the Behalf of my Assistant, that our Author has
deriv’d no little Improvement from them.</p>

<p class = "preface">
To these, I must add the indefatigable Zeal and Industry of my most ingenious
and ever-respected Friend, the Reverend Mr. <i>William Warburton</i> of
<i>Newark</i> upon <i>Trent</i>. This Gentleman, from the Motives of his frank
and communicative Disposition, voluntarily took a considerable Part of my
Trouble off my Hands; not only read over the whole Author for me, with the
exactest Care; but enter’d into a long and laborious Epistolary Correspondence;
to which I owe no small Part of my best Criticisms upon my Author.</p>

<p class = "preface">
The Number of Passages amended, and admirably Explained, which I have taken care
to distinguish with his Name, will shew a Fineness of Spirit and Extent of
Reading, beyond all the Commendations I can give them: Nor, indeed, would I any
farther be thought to commend a Friend, than, in so doing, to give a Testimony
of my own Gratitude. How great a share soever of Praise I must lose from my
self, in confessing these Assistances; and however my own poor Conjectures may
be weaken’d by the Comparison with theirs; I am very well content to sacrifice
my Vanity to the Pride of being so assisted, and the Pleasure of being just
to
<span class = "pagenum">lxvii</span>
their Merits. I beg leave to observe to my Readers, in one Word, here, that from
the Confession of these successive Aids, and the Manner in which I deriv’d them,
it appears, I have pretty well fill’d up the <i>Interval</i>, betwixt my first
<i>Proposals</i> and my <i>Publication</i>, with having my Author always in
View, and at Heart.</p>

<p class = "preface">
Some Hints I have the Honour to owe to the Informations of Dr. <i>Mead</i>, and
the late Dr. <i>Friend</i>: Others to the Kindness of the ingenious <i>Martin
Folkes</i>, Esq; who likewise furnish’d me with the first <i>folio</i> Edition
of <i>Shakespeare</i>, at a Time when I could not meet with it among the
Booksellers; as my obliging Friend <i>Thomas Coxeter</i>, Esq; did with several
of the old 4<sup>to</sup> single Plays, which I then had not in my own
Collection. Some few Observations I likewise owe to <i>F. Plumptree</i>, Esq;
Others to the Favour of anonymous Persons: for all which I most gladly render my
Acknowledgments.</p>

<p class = "preface">
<span class = "footnote"><i>The Editor’s particular Pains taken.</i></span>
As to what regards my self singly, if the Edition do not speak for the Pains I
have taken about it, it will be very vain to plead my own Labour and Diligence.
Besides a faithful Collation of all the printed Copies, which I have exhibited
in my <i>Catalogue</i> of <i>Editions</i> at the End of this Work; let it
suffice to say, that, to clear up several Errors in the Historical Plays, I
purposely read over <i>Hall</i> and <i>Holingshead</i>’s Chronicles in the
Reigns concern’d; all the Novels in <i>Italian</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">lxviii</span>
from which our Author had borrow’d any of his Plots; such Parts of <i>Plutarch</i>,
from which he had deriv’d any Parts of his <i>Greek</i> or <i>Roman</i> Story:
<i>Chaucer</i> and <i>Spenser</i>’s Works; all the Plays of <i>B. Jonson</i>,
<i>Beaumont</i> and <i>Fletcher</i>, and above 800 old <i>English</i> Plays, to
ascertain the obsolete and uncommon Phrases in him: Not to mention some Labour
and Pains unpleasantly spent in the dry Task of consulting Etymological
<i>Glossaries</i>.</p>

<p class = "preface">
But as no Labour of Mine can be equivalent to the dear and ardent Love I bear
for <i>Shakespeare</i>, so, if the Publick shall be pleas’d to allow that He
owes any Thing to my Willingness and Endeavours of restoring Him; I shall reckon
the Part of my Life so engag’d, to have been very happily employ’d: and put
Myself, with great Submission, to be try’d by my Country in the Affair.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
